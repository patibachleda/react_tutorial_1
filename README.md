## Tic Tac Toe | Patrycja Bachleda

### Summary
##### A React application that imitates the game "Tic Tac Toe" where players take turns, each trying to align their symbols into three in a row.
### Objective
#### This project was completed as a beginner tutorial from https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html to dive into React to understand the framework and React Javascript syntax.
Additionally, this project also helped to explore GitHub pages and how to use GitHub as a hosting service for my future React applications.
